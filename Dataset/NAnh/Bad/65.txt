Don't plan on going to the other park
I was thinking I was clever trying to go to three top ranked things on tripadvisor in one fell swoop, ack: I foolish I was. NHK Studio Park is for children, Yoyogi park is for... I don't know, people who want to have a hard time going to Meiji Jingu? You'll have to walk 5000m from the park to get to the shrine as they're fenced off.

The temple itself is beautiful but too much like the other temples in Tokyo, go to the one in Akihabara for something different instead.
