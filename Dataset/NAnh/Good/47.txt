Worth the visit (read this tips)
1. Remember entrance ticket fee is a separate ticket from Express ticket fee.

2. Do get your express ticket (I chooses 4 ride) it saves you tons of time queuing.

3. If you are not getting the express ticket, then separate from your group of friends and take the single lane instead.

4. You can bring empty water bottle inside to refill water in the park. No outside food allowed.

5. Organise which ride you want to go first then move from there, instead of running back and forth. It saves your energy.

6. Not enough cash to buy those cute souvenir or dine in restaurant? You can use credit card.

7. There a small Q beside the Harry Potter shop nearby the giant tree, you get to visit the experience how Ollivanders in Diagon Alley chooses the wand. Surprise? He will select a random person from the crowd and gave out a wand.
