Great temple, shame about the crowds
Like many tourist destinations in this busy city, The Golden Temple is worth a look but be prepared for a lot of people. I have visited in Summer, Spring and in Autumn and it's been crowded every time. Go early in the day before the bus tours arrive around 10am. The temple itself was burned to the ground in the fifties so what you see is a replica, and it is stunning, as is its position next to the lake. Ginkaku-ji's gardens are also good, although in my opinion not quite as spectacular, in the autumn at least, as those at Ginkaku-ji and several other shrines in the city.
