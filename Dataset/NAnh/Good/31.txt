Timing is Everything
Before coming, I had read the reviews about crowds and was expecting the worst. To my surprise, although busy, it wasn’t “out of control”.

We were here on a Thursday in early December - the estimated crowd (google USJ Crowd Calendar) forecast 17,000. Queues for the popular rides were around 1hr though we went as singles which typically meant 10-20min waits.

Harry Potter was the highlight with the rides and “streets” having a very authentic integrated feel.

The Flying Dinosaur was the definite thrill ride, being both long and terrifying.

One negative is that some “rides” are only in Japanese. For Jaws that didn’t really matter, but Backdraft lost a lot of impact. Most major attractions that we visited, the language didn’t matter or they did dual language or sub titles.

You can’t leave and re enter so you have to buy food there (not allowed to bring in?). Food was ok but expensive as you might expect.
