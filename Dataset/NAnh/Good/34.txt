Loved the Harry Potter ride
Loved the Harry potter ride but the place was crazy crowded. Lot of people in Harry potter costume gave it a even more appropriate feel. We somehow managed to do all the rides ones even with the crowd. Kids loved the Butter Beer (Harry potter drink). Would recommend reaching early in order to be able to do all rides. We were thinking about taking the express pass but didn't take it. The rides are all well managed and the crowd moves quickly.
