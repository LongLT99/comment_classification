Main Shrine Building is CLOSED
Japan-guide.com writes: CONSTRUCTION NOTICE:
In preparation for the shrine's 100th anniversary in 2020, renovation works are carried out on some of the shrine's buildings from spring 2016 to October 2019. Efforts are made to keep the impact on visitors very low.

But it isn't really true. The loooong beautiful forest walk is open. The square is open. But what you really want to see, the Main Shrine Building, is closed! I was so disappointed! It's Friday, May 26 today. How long it is closed for, I can't say. But I would not go there unless I were sure it i had opened. Could be a month- or a year- from now for all I know.
