Nothing but tour groups!
Kinkakuji (with gold leaf pagoda). Yowza - what a nightmare. Tour groups as far as the eye can see and every person is trying to take a picture of the pagoda with their friends, without their friends with the family, by themselves etc. The groups moved so slowly that I couldn’t take it so I went against the tide of people to get out of there
