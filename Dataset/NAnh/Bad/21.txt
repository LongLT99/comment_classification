Beautiful temple....Congo line of people...
Whilst it is one of the main attractions in Kyoto it’s certainly not my favourite. The temple is splendid and the pond in front makes the view beautiful there and hundreds if not thousands of people there at the same time so you cannot appreciate the scenery and what is supposed to be a place of worship and respect.
Overcrowded is an understatement.
