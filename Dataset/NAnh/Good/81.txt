AMAZING TEMPLE spoilt by loud, gobby tourists.
This should be a beautiful, relaxing and serene temple and gardens but it was so crowded and spoilt by people shouting, yakking, pushing and shoving for the perfect instagram photo rather than taking in and enjoying the beauty in a respectful quiet manner. If the people had shut up it wouldn't of mattered how many were there. However, the temple is so so beautiful and pretty, we went mid afternoon but if we returned we would try go very early morning to avoid the above.
