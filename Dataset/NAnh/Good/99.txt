You are not going to Kyoto if not visiting Kinkakuji !
November 2019 is my second visit to this temple. The stunning gold temple is always attractive for a photo object. I went there in the sunny day afternoon, the sun light is too strong, and makes me difficult to get the proper photo lighting for the gold shining temple.
I think, the best time to visit the temple is in the morning or when the cloudy day.
Tripod is not allowed to be used in this area, so be ready to ask other visitor to help take your picture.
