Lovely, clean grounds and cute merchandise!
(Skip the Christmas Crystal show)
It was my second trip to USJ this year. The first time around May this year and I thoroughly enjoyed myself even going with 2 very young kids (1.5yo and 3.5yo) My kids were very entertained with Sesame street, Minions, Hello Kitty and the Snoopy rides. If you were wondering if bringing young kids is difficult, it is not. It is a kid friendly place although with very young kids it is still quite a hassle. There are also plenty of food options. I unfortunately did not manage to try the exciting rides so I can't review those. The night parade was especially spectacular! My husband was blown away and decided to purchase the annual pass because of the parade.

HOWEVER, from 14th November 2019, the nightly parade is being done away and in its place is a Christmas Crystal performance which would cost you a further ¥1500+ to watch it. SKIP IT. The performances were rather nice...there were fireworks at the end but I think it would only entertain true Christmas fans. There were no familiar USJ characters participating in the Christmas performances so kids might get bored fast. We thought the usual nightly parades are so much better.
