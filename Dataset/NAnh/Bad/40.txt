Nice shady walk on a hot afternoon
A tall wooden Torii gate opens out to a large forest of old beautiful trees. Many people make an effort to visit this forest. After walking for about 10 minutes along a broad avenue which was almost completely shaded from the hot afternoon sun, we arrived at the Shinto shrine dedicated to Emperor Meiji and his consort . We witnessed a funeral in procession, with priests in full ceremonial costume. At the main hall, people were making offerings or praying. The walk is not difficult, as the slope is very gentle and the path very level. We were tired after visiting another museum and garden, so did not have the energy to walk to the Treasure House nor the Inner Garden.
