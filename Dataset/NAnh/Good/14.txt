Good Code A Day without Express Pass
We bought our tickets online from Klook for Code A week and the tickets are emailed to us and we just printed the tickets directly. Do not resize the tix. QR code is scanned at entry.
We arrived at 8.30am and park opened at 9.30am. We ran to Harry Potter for our 1st ride. I think it is better to do Flying Dinosaur as 1st ride and then go to Harry Potter for picture taking. You may ride Harry Potter after 7pm with no wait at all. On average, Flying Dino has a 100min wait. Maybe it is due to the fact that it was closed for 1-2 hrs in the late morning. All other rides were a wait of 15min to 30min. Minion is 45min but i think it was due to the silly introduction which I almost drifted off to wonderland. We didnt watch any show since it was in Japanese. In between we had more than 2hrs of rest for lunch and dinner and after 2nd ride of Harry Potter after 7pm, we had more than 2 hrs of free time for shopping! We did sit all rides.
A family of 7 bought the 7 express passes and told us it was truly a waste of money as the wait wasn't long. However you may check if other weeks require express passes.
