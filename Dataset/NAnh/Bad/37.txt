Waste of time
A not-so-old shrine with no particularly attractive features. I think that the place has meaning to the locals in terms of religion or tradition (best thing was seeing a little boy dressed up in traditional gear) but, for tourists, I am not sure of the point.
In great Yoyogi park but I am not sure that the shrine is worth going off your way if you are visiting the park.
