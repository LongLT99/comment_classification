Beautiful - from a distance
We went during fall foliage. Even though it was too early and wasn’t happening much yet the crowds here were massive. I guess most of the year it’s the same.

I was literally pushed a few times , so would not interfere with a person posing with Kinkakuji behind them across the lake.

The crowd control attendants here really have their job cut out for them. They do it with some humor, at least the person there when I came.

Sure the view is beautiful - what’s not to love about a gold painted pavilion shimmeringly reflected in the water with trees on rocks in the foreground? But once you get close you realize it’s a basic building with no effort made in design or embellishments to the structure. I guess gold speaks volumes.

The rest of the gardens are fairly unremarkable too. Really, if you want to see Kyoto’s best temples, skip this one if you’re short on time. I did last time I was here and having finally seen it, I stand firm in my opinion.

Maybe if you’re here at the height of summer you’ll be lucky to miss the crowds, which really destroy the enjoyment. But I doubt it.
