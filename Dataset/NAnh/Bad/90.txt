Greatly disappointed!
My wife and I visited the Portland Japanese Garden in August at 10am. We arrived early and got a nice parking space in front of the garden. I tried to purchase tickets at 9:20am and was told unless I was a member I would have wait until opening for nonmembers at 10. We briefly explored the free rose garden which is beautiful. Prior to 10 we had to wait in a long line for tickets, and they waited until exactly 10 am to sell tickets.

The ticket seller was once again pretentious and unfriendly. We expected a wonderful time in this treasured and acclaimed Japanese garden, but was extremely disappointed. First the garden is very uneven, with rough walks and steps and random routes. The garden is not accessible. Although the water ponds and waterfalls are great, the landscape is greatly overgrown and not manicured like traditional Japanese gardens. In Summer the garden is just green with no flowers or color. The main new area was closed as well.

My recommendation us to avoid the overpriced Japanese garden. The garden really needs a tour guide to understand the hidden meanings, the the staff us too busy. visit the free International Rose Garden which is far more enjoyable and absolutely beautiful.
