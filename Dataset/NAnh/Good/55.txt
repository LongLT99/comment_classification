A fun day!
We came to USJ on the eve of Halloween and it was very crowded (not sure if it was more than usual). But besides that we had a great time exploring the park and taking various rides.

A highlight (and the main reason) for me to visit USJ was the Harry Potter attraction. It was particularly special at night when the lights were turned on.

What I really liked about USJ was that there were ample benches around if you got tired walking and wanted to rest for abit. What would be nice is if there were more English translation for the attractions.

Tip: if possible, buy your tickets online so you skip the long queue at the ticket booth. It will save you at least half an hour. If you are a tourist and buy enough merchandise to claim back tax, be prepared for a VERY long queue.

At the end of a long day, we were exhausted, hungry and not prepared for the super long queue to claim back tax! (It took at least 45 mins.) This is no fault of USJ though, the staff tried to get through the line as fast as possible but the time taken was simply due to the number of tourists. Just a heads up incase this is useful for anyone.
