A small USJ park, crowded, business minded feeling
the overall impression of this USJ Osaka was small, crowded park with less attractions and very business minded kind of feeling. Some attractions are alright e.g Hollywood wonderland, Harry Potter castle, Amazing Spiderman etc, the rest was ok, no surprised. Food are boring yet expensive and long queue as any Uni Studios e.g. burger, pizza, fried chicken rice etc. If you were first timer visiting Uni studio, you might be having lots of fun, but if you have visited other Uni studio, then Dun expect too high
