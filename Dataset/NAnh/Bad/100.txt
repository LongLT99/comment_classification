Seemed like an overpriced tourist trap
This is a nice attraction. However, at a $17 entrance fee, I expected more. If there were no cost to enter, this would be a 4-5 star review. At $17, I have to bump it down to a 2 star review. The line to enter was long, the parking was difficult, and traffic around the area was horrible. If I had it to do again, I would save my time and money for something else in Portland.
