A must visit
The place was great, specially the Harry Potter area, the butter beer is a must, the ques are very long tho, but we had the express pass so we were able to zoom right in front, it's worth the extra charge, a lot of attention is in Japanese so we weren't able to understand 70% of the shows, but it was a great experience
