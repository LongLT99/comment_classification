Way Too Expensive for Us!!!
My wife and I had last visited the Japanese Garden a couple decades ago (before kids and double-digit prices). We planned to take our two teenage kids there today, as part of a Spring Break outing to Portland - but were astounded and disappointed to find such a high cost of admission ($16.50 for adults and $11.50 for kids). As a single-income family struggling to get by, the price just isn't in our budget. $53 for a family of four is ridiculous!!! The exorbitant pricing seems decidedly elitist and is a major turn-off for us. We turned around and left without ever getting to see the gardens. The traffic congestion (in the middle of a week day afternoon) was also a big negative. We parked blocks away and walked (at least we got to see some nice, old houses).
