For the price, it’s not that nice
Paying $16 entry I was expecting breathtaking displays and the grandeur of the emperor’s palace.

The weather didn’t lend itself to beauty but a 15 minute stroll at normal walking pace, none of the sights commanding our marvel, was enough to see the whole thing.

Additionally the bulk of people on Sunday afternoon was suffocating. The feeling of constantly being in someone’s way evaporated any impetus to stop and enjoy. And as I said above, the underwhelming spectacle created more an atmosphere of “let’s get this over with” than “let’s savor this” in the crowds present.

I would not pay $ for this
