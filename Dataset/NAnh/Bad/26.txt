Beautiful Tourist Trap
Felt like herding cattle. Very crowded with no room to pass the people in front of you, as you follow the path towards the exit. Beautiful gold leaf temple, garden, and reflection pond but it is a major tourist trap and there isn’t much else to see or look at other than the basic souvenirs and ice cream on the way out.
