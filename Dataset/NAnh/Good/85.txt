Unesco heritage site
The Golden Pavilion is quite a sight to behold and the main highlight of the visit. The rest of the site is mainly the gardens and some former living quarters which we found less interesting. We were there during the off-peak season so it was not super crowded. Hence we could take a more leisurely stroll around as well as get good unobstructed photos. However as it was cloudy, the photos were probably not the best.
The paid visitor route (one way) takes you around the pavilion for viewing and photos and then away to other parts of the site.

We managed to reach the site quite easily by bus. But you also use the train.
