Catching up to Tokyo Disneyland
Our second visit. We did not spend time on the rides and our main purpose was to spend time on Harry Porter area and to watch their Christmas show. It was fun for the children at the Harry Porter area to use the wand for various actions. The special effects of the show were commendable.
