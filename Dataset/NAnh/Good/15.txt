Great visit for families
We had an extra day in Osaka and decided to visit Universal studios with our 7 year old. It is highly recommended to buy entrance tickets ahead of time (available here on trip advisor) and show up at least 30min before opening to take advantage of the first 30 min when waiting time is low. We bought the 4 ride express pass at the gate and while it saved us about 30 per ride on a rainy Monday in December I believe this is a must for weekend visitors during peak season. Harry Potter ride and experience was great and very impressive, we also enjoyed the minions and Spider-Man as well as the traditional roller coasters.
