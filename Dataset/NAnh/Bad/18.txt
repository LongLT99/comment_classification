Rebuilt in the 50s
Disappointed when I learnt that it was rebuilt in the 50s (much like many places in Japan unfortunately - apparently something happened in the 40s nobody wants to talk about and earthquakes in the area are particularly unforgiving).

It is always photographed from a certain angle and I can guarantee that in every photo on this site there are 50-100 people within 8-10ft.

Also costs to enter and there’s not much else to see at this particular site.
