A long, fun filled family day.
Purchased entry tickets plus express 4 from Klook for 2A, 2C (8 & 10) as the only day we could attend was a Sunday. Not cheap! Surprisingly, the waits for rides didn't exceed an hour but our express pass certainly helped when we were tired at the end of the day. Arrived 30 mins before opening and left 30 mins before close and we didnt do all the rides.
Kids loved Jaws (did it twice), Harry Potter, Spiderman, Terminator, with most enjoyable and memorable moments going to Jurassic ride (be warned - if you are in the front - you WILL get wet!) We didnt do rollercoasters due to both waits and lack of interest.
A couple of rides/ experiences are lost due to the language such as Backdraft and Minions. Waterworld was action packed and even without speaking Japanese were were able to still enjoy in the pre-show activities thanks to the great actors.
Buying a wand and casting spells, watching stage shows throughout USJ and soaking up the atmosphere all made for a fun family day.
We found although the food looked amazing, didnt really taste that great and we craved a decent meal by the end of the day.
