Boring
It's a very boring place, I'm not sure why it has so many review. It has so many people visiting there, but it not nothing to see. I guess it's because I been to many of the places in Thailand like that, comparing to those in Thailand this is nothing. Also, I found the gift shop store there is more expensive those in the airport. It's very disappointed. I don't think it's worth to go.
