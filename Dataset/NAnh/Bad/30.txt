A Touristy Temple Trap
Completely over run with hordes of people, screaming children and tour guides with megaphones. This place is now devoid of any of the peace and serenity it once had. The grounds are very restrictive and are designed to funnel the masses of people through the area as quickly as possible.

Not worth the time or money unless you are in it solely for the photos.
