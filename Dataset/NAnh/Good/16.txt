One of the best theme parks in Asia
Be sure to arrive early in the park as the lines go very long in the middle of the day. For foreigners it is best to buy the 1.5 day pass so you can explore the park more and take many pictures. Also it is advise to eat first before entering the park because the food is quite expensive inside if you are on the budget. Be sure not to miss the night parade and ride Hollywood dreams, flying dinosaur, and Harry Potter.
