Fantastic Day at Universal
I would recommend that you buy the tickets ahead of time to avoid the long line at the ticket booth. There is a line also entering the park and lining up at the popular rides takes 45 mins at least. They are very organized so the waiting is not that bad. There are many restaurants inside which sold good food. The park is not as large as Universal Studios in LA, but it's big enough that you can try all the attractions all day.
