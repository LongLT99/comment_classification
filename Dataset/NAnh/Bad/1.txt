We arrived about 10 or 1030, packed with tour groups and so many people it was difficult to enjoy. They definitely don't limit the number of visitors to a reason number. We were there in the busy fall season time on a lovely day but we didn't enjoy all the crowds and I'd recommend going when it's less busy to going somewhere else instead.
