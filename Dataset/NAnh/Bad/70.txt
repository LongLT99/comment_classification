Baffled by the good reviews
I'm deeply confused by the 5 star reviews. I realise this shrine is of culture significance, so perhaps people feel bad giving a low rating, but it really wasn't a great sight to see.

The walk through the forest was very pleasant and it smelt absolutely wonderful. It was also lovely and cool, which was pleasant after the hot Sunday crush of Harajuku (highly recommended!). However, the shrine itself has been fairly recently rebuilt and was plain and completely uninspiring. Judging purely as a non-Japanese visitor interested in aesthetically pleasing sights, I cannot recommend this shrine.

If you have time go to Nikko or Kyoto where the temples and shrines are absolutely breathtaking.
