Better than nothing - but not by much
If you only visit Tokyo on a trip to Japan, and are only staying a few days, and only have a little time to look around, and big old (looking) buildings are your thing, then maybe a quick trip to Meiji Jingu is worth it. Frankly, it takes about 30 seconds to look at it, stick your nose inside, and then walk out. The grounds are nice, the walk into the area pleasant enough, but it is hardly a highlight of Japan.
Yes, it is quiet compared to much of the huge metropolis. But if you came to Tokyo for a quiet relaxing break...hmmmm. And you cannot eat your packed lunch there, oh no, much to disrespectful. Go to the park next door.
Are there better temples/shrines in Tokyo? Well, since they are all pretty similar, and only the surroundings differ it is much of a muchness.
Better than nothing if this all the 'temple trekking' you are going to get.
