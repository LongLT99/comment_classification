Filled with fossils
The fossils, of course, are of the living variety. This place is filled with senior citizens with nothing else to fill their time. They appear to be bussed in, and they all walk along with a bored look on their faces.

Meiji Jingu is a relic of a culture that has long since died. If you are truly interested in this piece of history, read about it. Do not spend your precious vacation minutes here thinking you are soaking up true Japanese culture.

Instead, take a walk down Omotesando Dori, about five minutes away by foot. Stroll down as many of the side streets as possible. They are filled with boutiques, galleries, bistros and cool little spaces where the youth of Japan are creating a fashion culture that radiates out to the rest of the world. This is where you can truly soak up an ambience that is quintessentially Japanese.

And really, if you've seen one rebuilt Japanese temple, you've seen them all.
