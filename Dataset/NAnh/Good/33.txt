Good, but you need to pay attention for all
First of all is not as the same as the universal parks in USA, and I got a little beat surprised that there open the doors of the park earlier, also you need to ask for all the information about the schedule of activities, also in weekends you need to reserve a fast pass or when you enter the park go for the fast pass of the attractions you must like.

In my case I also had a problem in the tax free, and the don't help me. In the park all the things were well but after buying a lot of things they don't return you the tax of 10% only 8% also if you buy things for a friend in Japan you can apply for it to tax free, because you can open the bag until you leave Japan.
