Fun and well maintained park
Overall the park was a pleasant visit. It had a combination of classic and new ride attractions. The roller coasters were the main highlight and were both thrilling and fun. As usual for amusement parks the wait times were hours long so an express pass at a much higher price may be the way to go to make waits less frustrating and exhausting. I would recommend this for all families visiting Osaka.
