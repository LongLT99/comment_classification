Though packed but queue is fast moving
Visited USJ in late November. I was contemplating whether to buy fast pass. However, due to the high cost, i have decided to give up the idea.
Arrived USJ before it opened. Waited outside for almost an hr before we are allowed in. Once in, we proceeded to the popular rides first. To our surprise, though there's queue, we did not wait long to get on the rides. On average, we waited for an hour or less to get on the rides.
