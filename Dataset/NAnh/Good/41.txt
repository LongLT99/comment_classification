Very happy amazing place happiest place on earth but expensive
Very happy amazing place happiest place on earth but expensive. Went during Halloween. A lot of effort put in by amusement theme park workers. Queues are long, but not unbearable. We used quick pass anyway which was very handy and definitely worth it.
