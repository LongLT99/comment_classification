So bizarre they charge for this
Super disappointed as we went here after reading reviews. Expensive at $17 per ticket to walk through a mostly unlabeled "garden" with a "view" of the city mostly clouded by the trees. It is more like a pretty park. There were employees trying to keep the "gardens" clean so some fee could be legitimized. But I felt like we were on candid camera with a crew laughing that we actually paid to see this. I have seen many other zen gardens, plant gardens and falls that were way more impressive. In fact, we left here and walked across the street to the free rose garden, which was way more beautiful. The koi pond does have a lot of fish but that should not be the highlight. They do have a shuttle for those who can not walk up the meandering path to the top or back down so that is a nice feature.
