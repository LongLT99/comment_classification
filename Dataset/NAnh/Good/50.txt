Great fun day out!
Super rides and great placemaking with fake streets and sets that look great. Staff were very happy and helpful and additional shows took place across the park for free.

Highly recommend the Harry Potter area, Jaws Ride and Jurassic Park rides.

The only downside was most announcements and video introductions to the rides didn’t have English subtitles (I don’t recommend going into Backdraft because the whole thing is explained in Japanese! Unusual considering it is an American brand)

Otherwise a highly recommended and fun day out, with affordable food options and a good selection of shops. Only big downside was no WiFi, not great for tourists who don’t have access to 4G and get bored in queues!
