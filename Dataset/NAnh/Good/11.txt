Wear the most comfortable
Shoes
Lots of walking ...

The park is magical , the attention to detail is beyond perfection .. the rides are different from
The other universals visited they seem longer and are more enjoyable .
Only negative criticism is that
The introductions to some rides like backdraft and the Minions is tooooo long before the rides start .. it seems like a delaying tactic to make it seem like u started the ride but its still another 10
minutes to the start of the ride and this is AFTER you get into
The ride ... i am not
Not talking about the queues before you start the ride .

But that said i LOVED the park loved the rides and will
Return ...loves the caramel
Popcorn .
Fast passes can be purchased with different options depending on which rides appeal to you ... worth it although very expensive . Most rides have the option of single riders which move very fast and beat the queues.
