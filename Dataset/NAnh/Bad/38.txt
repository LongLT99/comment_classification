SCAM
I bought this tour through this site for $95, waited at the designated hotel pickup location 15 minutes before I was supposed to be there, as I didn't want to miss it, and they never showed up! I called the number, and got a woman who argued with me, changing her story a couple of times about why it was my fault that they couldn't find me. I had a security guard who saw me waiting there the entire time. She refused to refund my money, so I guess I got scammed. :-( Very unhappy with TripAdvisor for posting this unscrupulous vendor. I would recommend instead just asking your hotel concierge for help... at least then you won't waste your time and money.
