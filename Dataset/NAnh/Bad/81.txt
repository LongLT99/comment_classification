Attitude is part of the Garden
I love to see nature as part of my relaxing activity. Japanese Garden was on top of my list when I needed to relax and not think about anything but the moment. I bought a annual membership thinking this will enhance my life in Portland. On Father's Day last, I went here with my two daughters and hubby to celebrate Father's Day. I had just gotten into an accident and had a concussion and could not do much but walk. An employee saw me taking pictures of my daughter with my apple phone and asked me to not do this because I needed to pay for photography fee. I was so surprised!
