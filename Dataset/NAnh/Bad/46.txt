Nothing Special & Bring Soap
Unimpressive and super crowded. Not a must see but include if you are interested in experiencing Takeshita street or another site nearby. We went an hour after it opened and it was already crowded. By the time we left 1 hour later, it was wall to wall people. If this Shrine is important for you to learn about, I suggest hiring a tour guide (no more than 1 hour) as there is minimal information provided in English and the buildings at the Shrine are all fenced off so you cannot see anything in detail. You can go inside for the main Sanctuary if you want to pray. We saw a section of hundreds of people waiting to go in to pray after paying 100 Yen. I'm not sure if there is a cheaper way to get in. The grounds are pretty, nothing special or interesting in terms of the rest of Asia. They are supposedly sacred yet interestingly, the Shrine is surrounded by food street vendors. There was a place to write your New Year's Wishes on a wooden block (probably for a fee) that hangs on a structure next to the Main Shrine. It was interesting and sweet to read the messages.

Bring soap. There is no soap in any of the bathrooms at the site. It is not that the soap dispenser is empty -- it is that none were ever installed (we found this at many other public sites in Tokyo) - just gross.

Finally, we walked around by the street vendors and stopped for a few minutes to watch a woman making takoyaki. we were standing next to her stand - not in front of it. After a few minutes, she glared at us and said "shush" and waved us away like we were some bugs. It was the perfect ending to our visit to this Shrine and Tokyo.
