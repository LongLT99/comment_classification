Crowded but great
One of the unmissable sights of Kyoto. We got here at around 11 a.m. and it was already crowded; an earlier start would have been more comfortable. But it is one of the three of Kyoto's most important sights (the others are the Imperial Palace and the Fushimi Inari Shrine). The gardens are pleasant, particularly in the fall season, and offer lots of photo opportunities as well. My photo is of the entrance ticket - a nice souvenir in itself.
