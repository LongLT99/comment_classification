Full day of fun
You would need 2 days to experience everything. Son particularly enjoyed the sesame street stuff and spiderman. The harry porter world was surreal. Highly recommend that one would reserve a time ticket to enter. Went in the morning without much fuss. However, come evening, was refused entry as we did not get the time ticket. The wand was not fully utilized. Till next time, expecto patronum...
