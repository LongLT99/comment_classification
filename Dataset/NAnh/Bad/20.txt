Just too crowded
There are SO MANY people and schoolchildren off buses here that I wish we had just not gone. It’s a modern reconstruction of the original anyway. Years ago we visited and could see the vistas and get some sense of its quiet; not anymore.

Try Ginkaku-ji instead, or if even that’s too crowded, Nanzen-Ji. Both have beautiful grounds and much more of a peaceful setting.
