A Must-go place in Osaka if you are a themepark lover!
It was raining since morning til late at night, even though i was drenched but i enjoyed myself on the roller coaster rides 'Backdrop' & the 'Hollywood Dream'. It was raining but the attractions continued operating thru-out, which i expect there will be closures for the rides. I went on Halloween season and played til 10pm at night... The staffs were very cheerful and friendly also helpful even though some of them cant really understand english. I will definitely visit again...
I bought the express pass 7, take note that you have to follow the timings to enter the attractions amd only 1 time use for each ride if you are getting the express pass...
