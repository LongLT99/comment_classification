My unforgettable....
Never been Universal Studio before. At first i thought it is more suitable for a family with teenagers, surprisingly i myself became one of them.??. Really enjoy view, the shows, foods, rides and a lots more.

I really impressed by the Harry Potter Attractions ie, Hogsmeade, Hogwarts Castle, the street entertainment etc... i know i will definately going again...

In fact, if only a day visit, it is not enough. I will recommend buying 2days Studio Pass. I bought Universal Express Pass 4 as well. I guess May could be a non peak season because some game i dont really need a long queues.

If you like to take photos like us...well one day definately not enough! So, plan your time!!
