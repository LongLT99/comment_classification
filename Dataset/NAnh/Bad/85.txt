Don’t let the lineups deceive you!!!
Went to this place cause it was a can’t miss in Portland. I’m the type of person that can appreciate nice parks and gardens and wouldn’t normally have issue with paying $50 plus for a family of 4. There was nothing special about this place at all. You can literally go through it in about 30 minutes walking slow. I don’t know? I just didn’t get it. I’ve been to places which were a LOT nicer for free. Don’t understand why there are lineups to this place either, let alone memberships jeeez. Who would ever want to go back. If it were free I’d maybe give it a 2-3 star rating.

PS this is the FIRST time I’ve ever been inclined to write a review of something. Not the complaining type but this place has inspired me.

Also, NO!! I am not interested in going back again. Don’t need a guided tour explaining the gardens to me. Wouldn’t change my opinion at all. I have no ill will towards this place, just not for me. I understand you guys get no funding and rely on charging the fees but REALLY? there is just not enough there for what you are charging.

My kids said that this is where Portland got the name Rip City from!!!
