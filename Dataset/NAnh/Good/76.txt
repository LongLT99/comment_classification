Simply breathtaking
I visited this temple last month when out in Japan with my son. There is a small charge to pass through into the stunning gardens. As you walk through an entrance and begin to walk around the lake you turn the corner and come across the temple. It is stunning, the setting and in late autumn, the multi coloured leaves on the trees are just beyond description.
