Fun and laughter
Universal studios Japan is a perfect place to visit when one is in Osaka . Its huge full of interesting themes like Harry Potter , Minions , Hollywood park and many more.
It's better to book the fast pass in advance otherwise there are 2 hours long queues for popular rides . Food is delicious , minion sandwich cookie is a must try .
