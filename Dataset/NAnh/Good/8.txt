It's Universal Studios - but in Japan!
Very weird coming here as it is SO similar to the one in Hollywood, minus the studio tour of course! But the whole feel of the place, and many of the rides and attractions, are exactly the same. We went because a niece is performing in one of the live shows, but in fact had a good day all round! The shows are brilliant and the rides we went on were also excellent. But Hogwarts as an area was the best part of the day! It just looks and feels as you would imagine it would do.
There are quite a few food options on the park; we had pizza for lunch, which was surprisingly good, and later on popped into the diner for drinks. Neither was ridiculously expensive given that you are in a theme park so are a captive clientele.
Getting to USJ is pretty straightforward on the Osaka subway and local train line, with just a couple of minutes' walk, clearly signposted, when you leave the station.
