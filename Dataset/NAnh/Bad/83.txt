Don’t come early for quiet - gas leaf blowers are everywhere
I had a short time to visit Portland and wanted to see the Japanese Gardens before work. I purchased a membership so I could go early at 9:30 but what a disappointment. Instead of birds, trickling water and quiet, there were half a dozen gardeners with gas leaf blowers all over. Why even offer early hours if you can’t even hear yourself think and the smell of gas is everywhere? What a waste - I hope I get a chance to visit again, but I don’t recommend coming during the week during the member hours. I get that they need to do maintenance, but it would have been nice to know what days the member hours would basically be a waste.

I also hope that some of my member fees can go to purchasing some electric leaf blowers which are much quieter, less polluting and don’t leave a terrible smell in the air.
