Golden Pavilion visit
We rode our rental bicycles from Kyoto city to the Golden Pavilion which a was a cool experience, entrance is only 400yen.
It got quite busy so be prepared for a lot other people trying to take a pic of the famous Golden Temple.

The other areas of the gardens are very beautiful and well maintained, a nice tea house and souvenir shop awaits visitors near the end of the circuit.
