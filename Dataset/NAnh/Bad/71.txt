Another shrine
This ranks as one of the top sites in Tokyo. The setting is pleasant, in a dense forest, and the huge tori arches are worth taking a picture of, but the shrine itself is post WWII, and somewhat baffling if you aren't of this culture. Candidly, it seemed very similar to any shrine in Japan, and many in China. If you're going to see one of the Shinto Shrines, I'd recommend Yakusuni Jinga, where there is at least some contemporary controversy to make it more interesting.

The map of the surrounding park notes a "treasure" exhibit on the northern end, but a walk there revealed nothing but closed buildings, that looked somewhat unkempt.

It was extremely hot when I went (early in the morning), and even making every effort to stay in the shade, I was soaked through by the time I left.
