Time to be a kid again!
What more can I say...it's a magical place to be! We were fortunate to come when there not too many people. We didn't even have to line up for the Harry Potter area. The attractions did not disappoint. There were places where we could refresh ourselves from the heat, love those water mist sprayers. Clean. Super cheerful and attentive staff.
