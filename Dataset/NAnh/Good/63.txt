Nice 1.5 day pass
I bought a 1.5-day pass. I get in from 3.00 pm on Wednesday. The studio closes at 10.00 pm. The next day I got up super early to stand in the line for Harry Potter. By Thursday evening, I could finish all of the activities, except for the flying dinosaurs. No food allowed. Very fun!
