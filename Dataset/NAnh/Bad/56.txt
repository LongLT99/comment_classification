Nothing special
We visited this temple as recommended by many sites but found it greatly disappointing. The temple is not as old as the site. When you approach the temple you are asked to give money before paying your respects, which we found very offensive. The walk up to it was nice as you don't see these size trees in every city. Trip was worth it for seeing a wedding taking place, but that was sheer coincidence.
