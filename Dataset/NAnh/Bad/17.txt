Way Overhyped
We went here right when the temple opened and it was absolutely packed. I had read on a blog to get there first thing in the morning, but that actually is not a good strategy. All of the school and tourist groups come right in the morning. There is literally nothing to see besides the temple. Then you're all herded on tiny pathways trying to get out. It was a terrible experience. There are so many better things to do/see in Japan.
