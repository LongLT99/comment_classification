Amazing
We went for the whole day and got an express pass package. The express pass was very expensive, but The ride times were well split up and made the day very relaxing to get around. It gave us plenty of time. We only speak english, but everything was easy to understand and most of the staff spoke some english, but all were very helpful and friendly, so full credit to them. Definitely worth the trip if you are in osaka. Easy to get a train from anywhere. You need the whole day if you want to go on rides.
