Very touristy, nothing special
I spent the day before in Nikko so obviously the Meiji Jingu couldn't live up to what I had seen the other day. It's very touristy and didn't think it was special at all. It's surrounded in a park, which is very close to Akihabara and really peaceful. Doesn't deserve being ranked as the 2nd best thing to do in Tokyo by far.
