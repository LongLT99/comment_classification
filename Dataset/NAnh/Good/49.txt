Winter Special is really special!
I booked a ticket to USJ on Klook (try to book on a weekday if possible) and since it was a Saturday, I expected the long queue, so I was there 10 minutes before it opened up. First mission, Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey.

I followed the attraction and ended up riding most of the rides, as I went there solo, so I could use the single rider lane. So the waiting wasn't really that bad for me, except for the Jurassic Park the ride (40 minutes queuing for a less than 1 min ride). Since I went there in November, they have already started their winter special, and boy oh boy, it was really special. Don't miss the Harry Potter Winter Special and the Crystal Night Parade. I suggest go for the Crystal first, then run to Harry Potter. The show for Harry Potter will repeat every 15 minutes for 2 hours. And for the show, the language is in English, so fret not for those non-Japanese speaking tourist.

Food for halal traveller can be tricky, but I found a pizza parlour that serves non-meat pizza and it was delicious.
Overall, don't miss USJ in Autumn. It would be better if I can't understand Japanese.
