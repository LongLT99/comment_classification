If you're visiting other cities skip this!
This temple was very simple and the grounds unimpressive. I'm slightly biased, I live near Kyoto which is famed for its temples.... But Meiji-Jingo was just plain and boring. If you practice Shinto or Buddhism and come here for religious reasons it's one thing, but if you come to see it as a tourist attraction it's a waste of time. I guess if you're only visiting Tokyo it'd be worth it to experience a traditional temple, but if you're going to be visiting Kyoto or any smaller town I'd just skip and and utilize your time elsewhere!! I just felt like the hour I spent walking through here could have been much better spent at a museum or on the streets.
