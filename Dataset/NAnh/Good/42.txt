Definitely a day trip worth !!!
Entrence price is a bit in the higher end (app. 8.500 yens) but it’s sure worth it. The rides are free of charge once you’re in and even though you just want to do a walk in the park and not try out rides - the detail work is very impressive and makes it worth visiting anyway !!

Especially the wizard world is dreamy, definitely the top area of them all !!

Season/Tickets
We visited in November so definitely out of the main season so neither had to wait long in entrence line, nor did we need the extra free tickets to the wizard world people have been writing about - because there weren’t that many crowds.

We also bought the tickets at the main gate but in high season I’d recommend to buy them in advance, the ticket-scan line should be shorter and faster.

Rides
For the main and most popular rides we waited at a maximum of 30minutes (even though the signs said 40-50min). We had the Standard tickets so it was more than descent waiting time knowing how long these lines can be.
If your main purpose is to do the rides or you’re visiting during prime season I’d recommend the Express ticket which allows one to skip the line through the fast track.
