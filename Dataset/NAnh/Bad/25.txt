Crowdy Crowdy Crowdy
It could be a very nice complex if there weren't thousands of tourists pushing their way through it. The golden temple and the complex are very beautiful, unfortunately everthing is destroyed by the massive rush. We were in this temple during the week and I don't want to know what it is like here at the weekend. Too bad.
