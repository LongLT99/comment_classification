My Favorite Temple In Kyoto!
It’s not called the “Golden Temple” for nothing. This beautiful temple, covered in gold leaf is my favorite temple in Kyoto. We caught it at the right time (1 pm) on a calm sunny day, to get perfect iconic photos with reflections of the temple in the water & excellent lighting (not shooting into the sun). It also turned out to be a good time to avoid peak crowds and it was easy to get a front row spot to take pictures across the lake. You cannot go inside temple, so just admire it across the water and tour the lush, landscaped grounds.

If you are interested in an itinerary for a nice day out, here's a suggestion. Visit Nijo castle first in the morning. The Castle is easy to reach by subway – Tozai line. Consider the tour in English at 10AM. Afterwards, it is easy to reach Kinkaku-ji from Nijo castle by bus. The best option is bus #12 from right outside the Castle (direction Ritsumeikan) - 17 stops to the Kinkakuji-mae bus stop, which takes 24 mins. Note that this stop is the one AFTER Kinkakuji-michi The #12 bus stops right outside the entrance to the temple complex.

After visiting Kinkaku-ji it makes sense to go to the Ryoan-ji temple as well, since it’s just an easy 15 minute walk away. Upon exiting the temple, walk to the street where you entered the temple and turn right. Follow this road until you reach the entrance to Ryoan-ji on your right hand side. You can also take bus #59 (three stops) between the two temples, but unless it’s really cold or rainy, it’s just as easy to walk This itinerary will put you at Ryoan-ji later in the afternoon so it will be less crowded & more enjoyable.
