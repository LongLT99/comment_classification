Harry Potter
We made a bee line straight to the Harry Potter world. The beer butter is must try but it’s really sweet. Recommended to share a cup amongst a couple of people just for the experience.
All rides in Harry Potter world are worth going for, we queue for less than 30min even without the express tickets.
