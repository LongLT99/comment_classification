Great for pics but don't waste time here.
Everyone, vloggers and travel writers rave about this place. I give it a big MEH! First it is big site with a lot of walking. Visually it is attractive. The shrine is in a park like area. In March, we didn't have overwhelming crowds, but we did visit on a Friday. I just was not impressed. For Japanese, this place represents an era. But I wouldn't waste the 2+ hours it takes to get in the site. I did it once, never again. There are more fascinating places in Tokyo.
