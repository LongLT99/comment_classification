Birthday visit!
We took my sister for her birthday and it was the best birthday ever! You can get a birthday sticker from any staff member in the shops and when staff see you wearing it, they wish you a happy birthday! All staff, in the street, at rides, at shops and even serving staff in restaurants (they list it as an item on the receipt so when you collect your food, all the staff know).

It rained a bit while we were there which kinda sucked but it wasn't heavy rain so it's didn't stop any rides or shows.

If you want to make sure to get on every ride, you should definitely buy the Universal Express Pass (you can buy tickets online even if you don't live in Japan, you just need a credit card). The queues for most rides are in excess of 120mins at any time of day. Express Pass will have you on the ride in less than 15 minutes.

Best rides to experience: The Flying Dinosaur (roller-coaster), Hollywood Dream (roller-coaster) , Spiderman (4D moving cart on a track) and Harry Potter Forbidden Journey (4D moving chair on a track).

Merchandise is far more expensive than other theme parks in Japan (such as Disney). But it's very good quality in most cases. You can get very cool light up goods for the night time, unique goods exclusive to the park and many fun headbands and hats to show your appreciation for characters.

The food is very yum, we really enjoyed eating at the Three Broomsticks in the Harry Potter area. It was very western cuisine such at pot pies, salads, whole corn on the cob, chicken with mashed potatoes etc. Felt a lot like being a student at Hogwarts for sure! And of course, during winter the hot butterbeer was a delight.
