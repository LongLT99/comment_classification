Waste of $78
With $18 entrance fees, my friends and I expected to be blown away by thid Japanese garden, that claims to be the best outside of Japan. Unfortunately (or fortunately) I have been to Japan and this garden looks like a normal house's backyard in Japan. It is small and has nothing special, except a tiny waterfall and koy pond with about 20 fish. The Japanese garden in SFO is significantly better than this one. Most of the running commentary from the tourists seemed to be in the similar tone.

Don't get me wrong, this place is beautiful. It is worth $5-$7 entrance for the hour it takes to walk through the place. It is simply just not worth $18.
