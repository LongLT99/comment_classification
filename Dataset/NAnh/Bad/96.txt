Overpriced, limited.
As a family of 4 we spent $50+. All day parking is $8. We were disappointed to see such a small garden for the price we paid. One can cover it in less than 1 hour walking very slow. If you do choose to visit tea house, beware of the treat sizes, pictures are misleading and they are tiny. We wished we went to rose garden across the street instead, which is free and worth visiting.
