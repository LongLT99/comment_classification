A peaceful place in the middle of Tokyo!
It was amazing to know that there is such a place even in the midst of crowded place in Tokyo. The entrance to the shrine is a good walk with lots of greeneries and then when you enter Meiji Jingu it is so peaceful. Worth the visit, close to Harajuku station.
