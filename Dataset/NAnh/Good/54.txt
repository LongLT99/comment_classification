Express pass ain’t worth it
My friends and I planned to get express pass to go on the rides but apparently you choose which one and what time and can only go once. They had one that was 7 rides express and costs nearly double the entry price. In LA, you can get an express pass and use it unlimited. We chose not to get the express pass and just follow the crowd but we had the plan by going in the single riders line which cut the time but made my friends and I seperate which wasn’t an issue for us. Also it wasn’t overly busy as the lines were pretty good.
