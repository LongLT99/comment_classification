Great fun
I had a lot of fun here. Although some shows were hard to follow as they were in Japanese (as can be expected) I purchased the express pass which included 4 rides. I went on a Tuesday and probably the only ride that helped having the express was the Flying Dinosaur ride. Most others it only took a max of 15 mins to get through. So it probably wasn’t worth the extra $$.
