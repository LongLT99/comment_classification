My kids are still laughing
Nice park to visit with kids. But you need express pass if you don't want to wait hours to ride the major attractions if you are travelling with young kids. The shows (Sing and Christmas were quite nice). Harry Potter part is a must, my kids loved it the "magic" wands... Also a lot of good places to eat and drink. Better balance than Disney in that aspect... I will come back again
