Good experience in November
We went because of the Harry Potter world. Did’t have to line anywhere to get a entrance ticket for the area. We ate at the three broom sticks... it was very plain and booring. Otherwise the HP area was amazing long lines for the rides. We only visited the castle inside didn’t go to any rides. Over all good experience visited all other areas of the park too. Every ride had a 1-2hour line.
