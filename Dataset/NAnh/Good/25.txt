Fun for all the family
We had 3 kids under 9 youngest being 6mths. All the kids had fun, and there were so many things for them to do. Great rides for the older kids as well as those thrill seeking older ones. We didn't get to go on all the rides partly due to kids, but also due to some wait times, so if you are going best to go mid week (we went on a Monday) or get a fast pass, its basically the same cost as admission but if you only get to do it once, you wont want to be standing around in ques and miss shows etc. But the atmosphere there is buzzing, so you really get into it.
