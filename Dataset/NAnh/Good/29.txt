Good fun
We'd already been to Universal Studios in LA, so this may have affected my rating as I'd already experienced this before. If I hadn't, I am predicting my rating might be higher. It was very similar to the US version we went to, except everything was in Japanese, at times hard to understand (especially for kids).

When we first arrived, we sent straight for the Harry Potter ride. It stopped half way through and we were left hanging for 2-3 ? minutes, luckily we weren't upside down. However, the staff were amazing, and let us ride a second time without having to line up.

The Terminator experience was amazing, I loved how they used a combination of 3D with people actors. Even though it was in Japanese, we could understand what was happening, it was very well articulated.

Food is very expensive! For a budget holiday, eat before you go, go early and then leave. We were there for about 3 hours. A fun family experience.
