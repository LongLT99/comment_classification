Beautiful Temple but Filled with Tourists
The temple is stunning but when we got here past 1PM, place is filled with tourists. And it's hard to appreciate the place when it's crowded. There were beautiful autumn leaves you can see here but it'll be hard to take a picture. It'll only take you less than an hour to walk around the whole park.
