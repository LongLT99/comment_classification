Expectations were much higher, then the real experience
I'll be short, but NO, we definitely do not advise going there. Just take a wildwood trail (Washington Park) and take a look at the Jap. Garden from the high up. Then you'll get an impression about the garden and most likely would not go.

1. Japanese Garden is way overpriced (yep, even though they do not get any funds from the City, the price could've been less (for such a short walk in the Garden)
2. Too small (you literally see all the beauty (and all the trees) of the Garden in it's advertisement pictures)
3. Over advertised (and I have no idea why recommend this garden to City visitors... there is plenty to do except for the Garden)
