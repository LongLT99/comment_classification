Not impressive
After a week in Japan you start to loose track of all the temples and shrines. Although this has a recent history and a very nice park around it, it is not remarkable. Actually it is the least impressive I have seen in the last week. The nice stroll through the park might make it worthwhile, but only if you are already in the area.
