Peace serenity and tranquility lost
The garden is beautiful but was lost to families with young children who do not appreciate the experience. It wasn't by any stretch of the imagination tranquil as a result. This is not a park to play in. It wasn't all of the children, it wasn't even most of them but the few with no respect.
