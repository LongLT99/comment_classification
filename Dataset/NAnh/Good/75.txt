Stunning!
Easily accessed from the local busses. Had a lovely 45 minute walk around and the Shrine itself is breathtaking. It truly is very well kept and absolutely exceptional.
It’s a shame about the loud and obnoxious tourists who ruin the atmosphere. There should be rules about noise and courtesy!
