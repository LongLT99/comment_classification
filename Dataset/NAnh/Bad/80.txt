Expensive to attend and pay parking. All uphill!
We were told this was a must to see if travelling to Portland. We found parking a block away and paid. The thirty plus that we paid to walk in the gate seemed okay. As we entered we encountered a continuously uphill climb a substantial distance. There were obvious empty streams designed to hold cascading water but some dork had not turned them on. We climbed and climbed until we were in the courtyard of some buildings that had some oriental influence in their design but certainly nothing as spectacular as the Chinese gardens we had previously visited. All but one of these were closed and it had an artistic display of minimalism which did nothing to impress me. The back of this display had a gift shop which had a piece of pottery that appealed to me. A small sushi restaurant was open. We walked throughout the site and a few of the trees were in bloom. One muddy pond held some large Coy. Try as we might we found it difficult to appreciate that this was a major attraction. Further down the hill as we left we ran into the Rose garden but in April nothing was blooming but we could see that it would be fantastic in the late summer. I wouldn't repeat the experience as there are many nicer places in Portland.
